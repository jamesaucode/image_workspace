A simple website for artists/designers to upload multiple reference images to work on their projects.
The project is in pure Javascript without any framework because I wanted to test my skill in javascript and also to learn more about DOM manipulation.

TODO:

1. Add a tab on the side that has the order and name of images added. *

2. Work on color and fonts. * (Not really..)

3. Add a function that re-organize all the images. *
    - Align them to the left.
    - Rearrange them so that the images are in order
    - (Problem) Prioritize filling gaps according to width first. (instead of purely rearranging according to the order added)

4. Implement a delete function *
    - Probably need to work on the style.

5. Fix the problem of left side bar not extending with the body height.

6. Implement a function so that images can be resized (ideally by dragging the edge of an image) *
    - Wrap the image around with a div *
    - Add 4 different resizers on the div *

7. Function to rotate an image.

* = Done
